/**
 * MDV - Diff Review (0.6.4: 差分バー + ハイライト + ジャンプ →
 * 0.6.8: 専用バーを廃止し、ツールバーの「変更 N」/「✓ 確認」ボタンに置き換え)
 *
 * Task ② of the 0.6.x review-surface plan
 * (docs/plan-review-surface-0.6.x.md) — see that doc's "② 変更ハイライト"
 * section for the ORIGINAL (0.6.4〜0.6.6) product spec and
 * docs/ARCHITECTURE.md's "§ WS file_update" / "GET /api/diff" notes for the
 * backend contract — both unchanged by 0.6.8, which only touches the
 * frontend surface described below.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 0.6.8: Word's 変更履歴 model — no more 3rd band
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Owner feedback verbatim: 「Wordと全く同じ機能にしたほうがみやすい。変更
 * 履歴on/offボタンを一番上におす。3列目でてくるのうざい」「機能が過剰」.
 * The standalone `#diffReviewBar` row that used to sit between the tab bar
 * and the content pane (0.6.4-0.6.7) is DELETED — no replacement band.
 * Instead, two buttons live as ordinary static markup in the TOOLBAR
 * (index.html, right after the Edit button, cached in dom.js's `elements`
 * like every other toolbar button) and are shown/hidden per active-tab
 * state by `_syncToolbar()`:
 *   - `#diffToggleBtn` ("変更 N", N = `_current.count`) — Word's 変更内容
 *     の表示 toggle. `aria-pressed` mirrors `_highlightsOn`; toggling only
 *     adds/removes the SAME .diff-added/.diff-changed marks (plus the
 *     0.6.10 removed-inline blocks below) as before (_applyHighlightClasses())
 *     — the ⌥↑↓ jump (_handleJumpKey()) is untouched and keeps working
 *     whenever those marks are visible. (0.6.8 remembered this choice PER
 *     PATH; 0.6.10 replaced that — see the "0.6.10" section below.)
 *   - `#diffConfirmBtn` ("✓ 確認") — identical action to the old
 *     0.6.4-0.6.7 「最新を確認済みにする」: adopts `currentHash` as the new
 *     baseline via markSeen(), which clears both buttons AND (via the
 *     onSeen seam below) the tree's unread ● in modules/unreadBadges.js.
 * Unknown-baseline/too-large (`kind: 'unavailable'`) shows "変更 ?" (title
 * tooltip 「差分は取得できませんでした」) + the confirm button, with no
 * highlighting — same case the old bar's "unavailable" branch handled.
 * Both buttons carry the `.hidden` class (no diff / non-diffable tab /
 * welcome / edit mode) — the toolbar shows NOTHING extra in the normal
 * case; that subtraction is the entire point of this revision.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 0.6.10: global markup toggle (default OFF), inline deletions, one color
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Three owner requests, all verbatim: 「トグルとかで変更履歴がでるかでない
 * かを選べるようにしてほしい」「削除行がwordみたいに横棒線がでるといいよ
 * ね」「デフォルトはオフでok この変更履歴のモードは」「追加も変更も黄色で
 * 良い気がする」.
 *
 * 1. GLOBAL persisted toggle, default OFF. 0.6.8's `_highlightsOnByPath`
 *    (a Map, reset per-path by markSeen()) is GONE. `_highlightsOn` is now
 *    backed by ONE localStorage boolean, STORAGE_KEYS.REVIEW_MARKUP
 *    ('mdv-review-markup', see constants.js) — `readMarkupPref()`/
 *    `writeMarkupPref()` below are the only functions that touch it. It
 *    applies to every file (Word's 変更履歴の表示 on/off is a single
 *    document-wide-feeling setting, not remembered per-document) and
 *    survives reload. Default OFF means a brand-new diff still shows the
 *    「変更 N」 count + 「✓ 確認」 (there IS a change to look at — that's
 *    still worth surfacing) but starts with NO highlights/inline deletions
 *    painted, until the user clicks 「変更 N」 to turn markup on.
 * 2. Deleted lines render inline, Word-style. `.diff-removed-after` (a
 *    small tick on the block after which a deletion happened, with no way
 *    to see what was actually deleted) is GONE — REPLACED by
 *    `.diff-removed-inline`, a presentational `<div aria-hidden="true">`
 *    injected right after the same nearest-block anchor the old tick used,
 *    showing the deleted OLD-text lines themselves (escaped, line-through,
 *    red-tinted) — see `_injectRemovedInline()`. Capped at 8 lines +
 *    「…（あと N 行削除）」. These are throwaway DOM nodes with no
 *    src-of-truth role: `_clearHighlightClasses()` removes every one of
 *    them on every re-paint (toggle OFF, ✓ 確認, tab switch/re-render,
 *    entering edit mode) — never leave a stale one behind. They never
 *    render in edit mode (refresh() hides everything there) or for Marp
 *    (canHighlight — and therefore kind:'full' — is never true for Marp,
 *    so `_injectRemovedInline()` is never called for a Marp tab; see
 *    styles.css's @media print / body.marp-fullscreen rules for the
 *    belt-and-suspenders CSS-level exclusion of the classes themselves).
 * 3. One highlight color. `.diff-added` and `.diff-changed` are still two
 *    separate CSS classes (kept for structure/tests/the ⌥↑↓ jump query)
 *    but styles.css now points both at the same yellow (`--warning`) tint
 *    — the green (`--success`) tint `.diff-added` used is gone. Deletions
 *    stay red-struck (item 2 above) — that is still a meaningfully
 *    different kind of change (nothing to show inline for pure adds).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 0.6.12: the markup toggle is GONE — Review mode subsumes it
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Owner's direction (Word's 校閲/Review tab mental model, see
 * modules/reviewMode.js's docstring): ONE permanent toolbar button
 * (`#reviewModeToggle`) now gates the entire review surface, not just
 * highlight visibility. 0.6.10's independent `_highlightsOn` preference
 * (STORAGE_KEYS.REVIEW_MARKUP, `readMarkupPref()`/`writeMarkupPref()`) is
 * DELETED — this module now imports `isReviewMode()` from
 * modules/reviewMode.js and treats it as the sole visibility gate:
 *   - `_syncToolbar()` hides BOTH toolbar buttons whenever Review is OFF,
 *     regardless of `_current` (previously only "no diff" hid them).
 *   - `_applyHighlightClasses()` paints nothing whenever Review is OFF —
 *     Review ON always shows highlights/strikethrough for a `kind:
 *     'full'` diff now (no more separate on/off within that).
 *   - `_handleJumpKey()` (⌥↑↓) is inert while Review is OFF ("shortcuts
 *     inert while OFF" — nothing is visible to jump between).
 * `refresh()`'s underlying diff computation is UNCHANGED by any of this
 * — background tracking (baseline recording, journal seeding, `_current`
 * itself) keeps running while Review is OFF, so flipping Review ON shows
 * the accurate current state immediately with no re-scan. See
 * modules/reviewMode.js's docstring's "Visibility gate, not a tracking
 * gate" section for the full rationale, shared with modules/
 * unreadBadges.js.
 *
 * `#diffToggleBtn` ("変更 N") also changes ROLE: it no longer toggles
 * anything (there is nothing left for it to toggle — Review ON already
 * implies markup shown). Clicking it now JUMPS to the next change, the
 * same action as ⌥↓ (`_jumpChange(1)`, shared by both the click handler
 * and `_handleJumpKey()`). `aria-pressed` is gone from this button
 * accordingly (a jump action isn't a toggle); `#diffConfirmBtn` is
 * unaffected.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 0.6.14: moved next to Review, renamed, and no longer pops in/out
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Three owner complaints, all verbatim: 「変更N/✓確認がEditとPDFの間にある
 * のはおかしい。Reviewボタンの右にあるべき」「『変更』というラベルは何が
 * 起きるか分からない」「ボタンが出たり消えたりするたびに後ろのPDF/Style/
 * Review/検索ボックスが横にガタガタ動くのがだるい」.
 *
 * 1. index.html moved both buttons from between Edit/PDF to right after
 *    `#reviewModeToggle` (before the search trigger) — pure markup
 *    reordering, this module doesn't care about DOM position.
 * 2. `#diffToggleBtn`'s label is now "次の変更 N" ("次の変更 ?" when
 *    unavailable) — it jumps to the next change, so the label says so.
 * 3. Layout stability: `_syncToolbar()` used to add/remove `.hidden` on
 *    BOTH buttons every time `_current` changed (pending diff appears/
 *    resolves, tab switch, ...), which visibly shifted every toolbar
 *    control to their right. Now `.hidden` is toggled ONLY by the
 *    Review-mode ON/OFF transition itself (one deliberate user click,
 *    acceptable) — while Review is ON, both buttons stay permanently
 *    MOUNTED and instead flip the `disabled` attribute:
 *      - `_current` is null (no pending diff / non-diffable tab / no tab
 *        at all, e.g. via `_hide()`) → both buttons disabled, label
 *        "次の変更 0" (nothing to jump to, nothing to confirm).
 *      - `_current.kind === 'unavailable'` → jump button disabled (no
 *        jump target — see `_jumpChange()`'s early-return), confirm
 *        button stays ENABLED (`_confirmLatest()` only needs
 *        `_current.path`/`currentHash`, both present here — confirming
 *        an unavailable diff is still meaningful).
 *      - `_current.kind` is `'full'`/`'bar-only'` (real pending diff) →
 *        both enabled.
 *    `disabled` (an HTML attribute, not a CSS class) both grays the
 *    button out (styles.css's `.toolbar-btn:disabled`) and blocks the
 *    click handler from firing — no extra guard needed in
 *    `_jumpChange()`/`_confirmLatest()` beyond what they already check.
 *    Every `_syncToolbar()` call now updates textContent/title/disabled
 *    on EVERY path (previously the hidden branches returned early without
 *    touching them, which was fine when hidden also meant "not visible
 *    to worry about" — now that the buttons can stay mounted, a stale
 *    label would otherwise flash before the next real update).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Baseline model (localStorage) — THE SHARED FOUNDATION 0.6.5 builds on
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * STORAGE_KEYS.LAST_SEEN ('mdv-last-seen') holds a single JSON object:
 *   { [path]: { hash: string|null, ts: number } }
 * `hash` is a content hash in the same `sha256:<hex>` format
 * src/utils/etag.js's makeEtag() produces (GET /api/diff's `currentHash` /
 * a `file_update` message's `etag`). `ts` is `Date.now()` at the moment the
 * client last confirmed having seen that hash (either "first sight" or an
 * explicit 確認済み click — see markSeen()).
 *
 * getLastSeen(path) / markSeen(path, hash) are the ONLY functions that
 * touch this storage key — 0.6.5 (未読●フォルダバッジ,
 * modules/unreadBadges.js; its ✓ badge was removed in 0.6.8, see that
 * module's docstring) imports both directly from this module rather than
 * re-deriving the schema. It also needs to know the MOMENT a path becomes
 * seen (first-sight, 確認 click, or 0.6.5's own フォルダ内を確認済みにする,
 * which calls markSeen() per-path) so its unread map can clear that path's
 * ● without polling — onSeen(fn) below is the tiny subscription seam for
 * that, rather than duplicating the "what does seen mean" logic in a
 * second module.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this module does NOT trust `tab.etag` as "always populated"
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The task brief for this feature (and the 0.6.3 author's handoff note)
 * describes `tab.etag` as "now truthy for ALL text tabs". That is true of
 * the `file_update` WebSocket broadcast (src/watcher.js stamps `etag` onto
 * every text-renderable file unconditionally) but NOT of `GET /api/file`
 * (src/rendering/index.js renderMarkdownFile() only computes `etag` for
 * Marp decks) — see modules/renderedFile.js's docstring for the exact
 * field table. Concretely: a freshly-opened non-Marp markdown/code/text
 * tab that hasn't yet received a live `file_update` has `tab.etag === null`
 * (renderedFile.js's CREATE-mode fallback).
 *
 * If this module blindly used `tab.etag` as "the current hash" it would
 * (a) silently mark a brand-new tab as "seen" with hash `null` instead of
 * its real content hash, and (b) on every later visit skip the fast-path
 * `tab.etag === lastSeen.hash` check (since `tab.etag` may still be null)
 * and ask the server — which is merely a wasted round trip, not a
 * correctness bug, EXCEPT for step (a): a `null` baseline can never
 * legitimately match a later real hash, so the toolbar would falsely claim
 * "changed" forever. _resolveCurrentHash() below closes that gap by
 * falling back to `MDVApi.diff(path, '')`'s `currentHash` (every /api/diff
 * response includes it except the one pre-hash "file too large to even
 * read for hashing" bail-out — see src/api/diff.js).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Wiring (no changes to modules/tabs.js — out of this task's file scope)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * refresh() is the single entry point that re-checks the ACTIVE tab
 * against its localStorage baseline and updates the toolbar controls/
 * highlights. Two
 * call sites, both wired from app.js's init() (see that file):
 *   1. WebSocketManager.setOnFileRendered(() => DiffReviewManager.refresh())
 *      — after a live file_update repaints the content pane (see
 *      websocket.js's docstring for why this exists).
 *   2. A wrap of TabManager.renderActive() (the one method every content
 *      re-render funnels through — tab open/switch/close, theme toggle,
 *      PDF-style-panel apply, and EditorManager.hide() all call it) so
 *      refresh() runs after every one of those, without tabs.js needing to
 *      import or know about this module at all.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Highlighting (markdown, non-Marp, only)
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Reuses the data-source-line attribute markdown.js's mdv_source_line core
 * rule bakes onto rendered blocks (see searchPalette.js's docstring for the
 * same building block used for search-jump). A block only carries its OWN
 * start line, not a span, so matching an added/changed [start,end] range
 * against blocks is two-pass:
 *   1. Any block whose OWN line falls inside [start,end] is highlighted
 *      (handles the common case, including a range that spans several
 *      consecutive blocks).
 *   2. If NONE do — e.g. a change to a later line of a multi-line block
 *      past its own tagged first line, a range that's entirely a blank
 *      *separator* line between two blocks (that separator doesn't belong
 *      to either block's visible content, so pass 1 correctly finds
 *      nothing there), or a range inside one of the wrapper tags markdown.js
 *      still leaves untagged on purpose (SOURCE_LINE_EXCLUDED_TYPES — the
 *      `<ul>`/`<ol>`/`<blockquote>`/`<table>` opening tag itself, NOT their
 *      `<li>`/row contents, which have carried their own data-source-line
 *      since 0.6.6) — fall back to the nearest PRECEDING tagged block, or
 *      the first block if the range is before all of them. Same fallback
 *      convention `removed[].afterLine` uses below (0.6.10 — it replaced
 *      removedAt as the anchor for what's now an injected inline block
 *      instead of a bare tick, see this docstring's "0.6.10" section; the
 *      resolved anchor is identical, only what gets attached to it
 *      changed), and the one searchPalette.js's _scrollToSourceLine() uses
 *      for search-jump.
 *      (Before 0.6.6, list items fell into this fallback constantly — a
 *      tight list's own `<li>` had no data-source-line anywhere inside it,
 *      so a changed 議事録 decision bullet always highlighted whatever
 *      heading/paragraph preceded the list instead of the bullet itself.
 *      Tagging `list_item_open` closed that gap; pass 1 now matches
 *      bullets directly, and this fallback is back to covering only
 *      genuine gaps like blank separator lines.)
 * (An earlier version of this matched ranges against each block's
 * *coverage* — its own line up to the next block's line minus one — but
 * that misattributed a newly-inserted blank separator line to whichever
 * unchanged block preceded it, e.g. flagging an untouched paragraph as
 * changed just because a new blank line was appended right after it.)
